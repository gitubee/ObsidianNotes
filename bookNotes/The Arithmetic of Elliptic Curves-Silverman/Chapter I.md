# Algebraic Varieties

We set the following notation, which will be used throughout this book:
> K   a perfect field, every algebraic  extension of K is separable.
> $\overline{K}$    a fixed algebraic closure of K.
> $G_{\overline{K}/K}$    the Galois group of $\overline{K}/K$.

The restriction on K that K is a perfect field need not concern us unduly.

## Affine Varieties

We starts with algebraic geometry with Cartesian (or affine) n-space and its subsets defined by zeros of polynomials.

##### Definition: Affine n-space
Affine n-space (over K) is the set of n-tuples:
$$
\mathbb{A}^{n}=\mathbb{A}^{n}(\overline{K})=\{P=(x_1,\dots,x_n):x_i\in\overline{K}\}
$$
 the set of K-rational points of $\mathbb{A}^{n}$ is the set:
 $$
\mathbb{A}^{n}(K)=\{P=(x_1,\dots,x_n):x_i\in K\}
$$
Notice that the Galois group $G_{\overline{K}/K}$ acts on $\mathbb{A}^n$; for $\sigma \in G_{\overline{K}/K}$ and $P\in \mathbb{A}^n$
$$
P^{\sigma}=(x^{\sigma}_{1},\dots,x^{\sigma}_{1})
$$
Then $\mathbb{A}^{n}(K)$ may be characterized by:
$$
\mathbb{A}^{n}(K)=\{P\in\mathbb{A}^n:P^{\sigma}=P\;for\;all\sigma\in G_{\overline{K}/K}\}
$$

Let $\overline{K}[X]=\overline{K}[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ be a polynomial ring in n variables, and let $I\subseteq \overline{K}[X]$ be an ideal. 
To each such $I$ we associate a subset of $\mathbb{A}^{n}$, 
$$
V_I=\{P\in\mathbb{A}^n:f(P)=0\;for\;all\;f\in I\}
$$

##### Definition: (affine) algebraic set 
An (affine) algebraic set is any set of the form $V_{I}$. If V is an algebraic set, the ideal of V is given by:
$$
I(V)=\{f\in \overline{K}[X]:f(P)=0\;for\;all\;P\in V\}
$$
**An algebraic set is defined over $K$** if its ideal $I(V)$ can be generated by polynomials in $K[X]$. And we denote this by $V/K$. 
If $V$ is defined over K, then the **set of K-rational points of V** is the set:
$$
V(K)=V\cap\mathbb{A}^n(K)
$$

###### Remark 
1. Note that by the Hilbert basis theorem [8, 7.6], [73, ยง1.4], all ideals in $\overline{K}[X]$ and $K[X]$ are finitely generated.
2. Let V be an algebraic set, consider the ideal $I(V/K)$ defined by:
	$$
	I(V/K)=\{f\in K[X]:f(P)=0\;for\;all\;P\in V\}=I(V)\cap K[X]
	$$
	Then we see that V is defined over K if and only if:
	$$I(V)=I(V/K)\overline{K}[X]$$

Now

###### Example 1.3.1
Let V be the algebraic set in $\mathbb{A}^2$ given by the single equation:
$$
X^2-Y^2=1
$$
Clearly V is defined over K for any field K. Let us assume that $char(K)\neq 2$. Then the set $V{K}$ is in one-to-one correspondence with $\mathbb{A}^{1}(K)-\{0\}$, one possible map being:
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{A}^{1}(K)-\{0\}&\rightarrow V(K)\\
t&\mapsto\left(\frac{t^2+1}{2t},\frac{t^2-1}{2t}\right)
\end{align*}
$$

##### Definition: (affine) variety
An affine algebraic set V is called an (affine) variety if $I(V)$ is a
prime ideal in $\overline{K}[X]$. 

Note that if V is defined over K, it is not enough to check that $I(V/K)$ is prime in $K[X]$. For example, consider the ideal $(X^2_1-2X^2_2)$ in $\mathbb{Q}[X_1,X_2]$.
